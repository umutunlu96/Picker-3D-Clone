I cloned the Picker3D game requested from me for my Level-UP Game Developer Bootcamp application.

I used;
S.O.L.I.D princible
Object Pooling
Observer Design Pattern
Scriptable Object
Dotween
Singleton
Cinemachine (2 camera used)
Unity new Input System
Level Loop System (which u can play single level forever if you don't fail).

I didn't used Unity intantiate method. All objects in the scene are recycling when triggered.

**Dotween used for Helicopter movement and Barrier Movements. It's really helpfull tool that you can Invoke other methods after end of the Dotween sequence.
